Any team member can start a Roles Advice Process (RAP) at any time if they feel a need to change anything about a role they hold or would like to hold. They contact the Roles Facilitator in their circle to help with the process.

First, colleagues who should be involved to provide advice and consent or would be impacted are invited. This can be the whole organization, a circle or a smaller group. Consider creating a temporary Slack channel for discussion around the process and invite people into that.
Second, the individual self-reflects (and can use other colleagues as a sounding board):
Why am I doing this advice process? What led to this?

What are my strengths, talents and interests? Where are they best put to use?
What contribution am I currently making to the team? What’s working well? What could be better?
Could I increase my impact by shifting or changing my role? In what ways, specifically? What could be gained? What could be lost? Who would assume current duties I’d like to hand off?
How do I feel about this potential change? What am I worried about? Excited about? What are the pros and cons?
Finally, the decision is made by the colleague proposing it with consent from colleagues who are directly impacted (usually the other members of the circle). There is only a blocking right for colleagues who are directly impacted by the role change. A blocker should come with a counter-proposal.
