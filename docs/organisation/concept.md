Each role at Centrifuge comes with a set of accountabilities that the person holding the role is  responsible for. Since roles belong to the organization, team members do not own a role, they rather energize it for a given period. Someone else was energising it before them, and someone else will after. Roles always include a purpose, accountabilities (outcomes the role enables), an explanation of what success looks like and several accountability questions.

Roles are energised based on a mix of expertise in the area, experience in delivering in similar roles in the past, the desire to learn the role, and energy and motivation. Energizing means you are accountable for ensuring the work happens, but NOT for delivering it on your own. This is a shift from ownership to “stewardship”. Roles are not hired. A team leader or ‘hirer’ hirers a human who has the right ‘personality type’ or characteristics needed to thrive in the team and the experience likely to be able to fulfil roles that belong to that team. This person may come from inside or outside the organization.

Every role is part of a circle. The biggest circles at Centrifuge are the Dev Circle + its sub circles and the Adoption Circle + it’s sub circles.

If you are a new team member, the roles you are energizing will be defined during the first three months at Centrifuge.
